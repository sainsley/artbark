This is our GR4 repo.

Here are some simple git commands:

git pull (pull in other people's changes)

git add <filename> (add this new file to your next commit OR add the changes in this file to your next commit--unlike SVN changes are not automatically added so your commits can be more specific)

git commit -m "What I did in this commit" (make a local commit that you will eventually push to the rest of us)

git push (push your commit to the rest of us)

git status (see what has changed and what is staged for commit)

Let's stick to a single master branch for now.
