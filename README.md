This is our GR4 repo.

Here are some simple git commands:

git pull (pull in other people's changes)
git commit --message="What I did in this commit" (make a local commit that you will eventually push to the rest of us)
git push (push your commit to the rest of us)

Let's stick to a single master branch for now.
